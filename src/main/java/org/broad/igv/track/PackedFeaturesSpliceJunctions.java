 * This class is a subclass of PackedFeatures that is for display of splice junctions. It overrides some
 * methods in order to deviate from superclass in two ways:
 * 1.  Features are allowed to be on the same line if flanking regions overlap
 * 2.  Overlapping features are allowed to be on the same line if they are from different strands
 * 3.  Features are ordered from top to bottom in ascending order of read depth
 * The goal is for the dominant isoform to appear on the top row.
 *
 * I think I've got the 90% case covered, but there's quite a bit of ambiguity here.  Some items for future work:
 * -The feature ordering will probably fail in certain conditions, e.g., an exon removal in which the situation
 * where the exon is present has more coverage in the first junction, but the absent-exon condition has more
 * coverage overall.  These are kind of degenerate cases, so only worth handling if someone complains.
